Exploring the San Francisco Assessor's Office data from 2007 to 2016.

This project is still in progress, but please check out **clean_data.rmd** to see how I have begun to clean and organize data on the assessed values of property in San Francisco downloaded from the Assessor's Office website. 

Also see **SFproperty.rmd** for the current state of plots and interpretation of the data. I have started by looking at market rate primary residences of homeowners in San Francisco.

There is also a Shiny app in progress.
